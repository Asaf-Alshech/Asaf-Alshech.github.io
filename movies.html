          <h2>La La Land</h2>
        <p>After his highly acclaimed film <em>'Whiplash'</em> from 2014, rising director <em>Damien Chazelle</em> continues focusing on the totality and sacrifice that artists make when persuing their dreams. <strong>La La Land</strong> is romantic musical comedy drama which doesn't sound promising, but is a great movie. The acting is fantastic and many scenes are overwhelming, including the breathtaking opening song. I highely recommend everyone to watch this film. </p>

          <h2>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</h2>
        <p><strong>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</strong> is a must see simply for one reason - it's a Star Wars film. Die hard fans will find answers to many question as well as jokes that only they will get. However, the charecthers are not memorable and the storyline is too complex. Overall, I was quite disappointed.  </p>
